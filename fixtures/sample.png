// filename: fixtures/sample.png
# This is a placeholder for the sample PNG file
# In a real implementation, you would place an actual PNG file here
# For testing purposes, you can use any simple PNG image such as:
# - A black square on white background
# - Simple geometric shapes
# - Text or logos to test the vectorization pipeline

# To add a real PNG file:
# 1. Create a simple test image (e.g., 100x100 black square)
# 2. Save it as sample.png in this directory
# 3. The file will be used for testing the complete pipeline

# Example test images you could create:
# - Simple geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles)
# - Text characters or simple logos
# - Images with holes (donut shapes)
# - Multiple separate objects

# Note: Keep the file size reasonable (under 1MB) for testing purposes
